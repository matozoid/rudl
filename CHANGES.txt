 + Added DisplaySurface.get (class method, returns the global DisplaySurface object)
 + added DisplaySurface.set_icon for setting the window icon
 + added Surface#mirror_x and mirror_y
 + added Surface#scale2x
 + added VideoExposeEvent which occurs when the window is uncovered
   (it was previously a nil event)
 + added automatic fixing of window clipping after a resize

 * fixed a couple typos that caused compilation errors on Linux
 * Surface#[] and []= now accept an [x,y] array as well as separate x,y coordinates.
   They are now the same methods as Surface#get and Surface#plot, respectively.
 * changed the default window title to "RUDL window"
 * Surface#set_colorkey(nil) now does the same as unset_colorkey, and
   set_alpha(nil) does the same as unset_alpha.
 * Surface.new now copies the palette if a 8-bit surface was supplied
 * Fixed segfault when calling set_palette(0, nil) (e.g. when trying to copy
   the palette from a 16/24-bit surface)
 * Made DisplaySurface#destroy also a class method
