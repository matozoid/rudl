 + added DisplaySurface.set_icon for setting the window icon
 + added Surface#scale2x
 + added VideoExposeEvent which occurs when the window is uncovered
 * fixed a couple typos that caused compilation errors on Linux
 * Surface#[] and []= now accept an [x,y] array as well as separate x,y coordinates.
   They are now the same methods as Surface#get and Surface#plot, respectively.
 * Surface#set_colorkey(nil) now does the same as unset_colorkey, and
   set_alpha(nil) does the same as unset_alpha.
 * Surface.new now copies the palette if a 8-bit surface was supplied
