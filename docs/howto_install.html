<H1>How to install RUDL</H1>

<H2>Linux</H2>

<P>Like other extensions:
<P>ruby extconf.rb
<P>should create a makefile, or complain.
If it says it can't find things,
it will point to a URL that contains the wanted libraries.
RUDL doesn't <I>need</I> everything, just SDL actually,
but it will be severely handicapped without all libraries.
If it complains, and you wished it would say a little more, you can edit extconf.rb
and uncomment the DEBUG-flag.
<P>make
<P>And now, as root:
<P>make install
<P>That's it.

<H2>Windows</H2>

<P>Don't trust this chapter, this is changing rapidly.

<H3>Source</H3>
<P>Source is now compiled with the Microsoft Visual C 6 command line tools.
They need to be set up with the "vcvars32" batchfile in VC's bin directory.
<P>This could be useful for creating a smaller RUDL library, depending on less libraries.
<P>What is needed is the header files and libraries that RUDL wants to link with.
These are available on request since I'm too lazy to package them :)
The rest looks like unix: "ruby extconf.rb" "nmake" "nmake install"

<H3>Binary</H3>

<P>This explains how to get RUDL installed on Windows.
Developers are advised to create a package with their program, SDL, and RUDL in it
so average users won't have to install RUDL seperately.

<P>Starting with 0.6, there will be binary versions.
These binaries <I>don't</I> work with the <A HREF="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ruby/downloads/ruby-install.html">Cygwin based Ruby installer</A>
(Ruby 1.6.5 is the last version to be Cygwin based).

<OL>
<LI>Grab <A HREF="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ruby/downloads/ruby-install.html">One Click Ruby 1.7.x Installer</A>.
Install it.
It might be necessary to reboot.
<LI>Alternatively, grab <A HREF="http://www.dm4lab.to/~usa/ruby/index_en.html">U. Nakamura's Visual C Ruby</A>.
It is reported to work.
<LI>Grab <A HREF="http://froukepc.dhs.org/rudl/download/binary/">the latest binary RUDL setup</A>.
<LI>Unzip RUDL to a place you like.
<LI>Run install-on-windows.rb.
I suggest copying the dll's to the Ruby bin dir when it asks for that.
<LI>Try one of the samples in the RUDL/samples directory.
</ol>

<p>If you decided that Ruby 1.7 is too unstable and you downloaded 1.6 instead,
you'll get trouble using RUDL.
This can be solved by downloading a lib only 1.6 RUDL.
You can put the RUDL.so in the directory where you unpacked the RUDL setup and rerun install-on-windows.

<P>If it doesn't run, contact me.
