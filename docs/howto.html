<H2>Ways to do stuff</H2>

<H3>Install RUDL</H3>

<H4>Install SDL</H4>

<P>Nothing special for now.
Just install it.

<H4>Linux</H4>

<P>Like other extensions:
<P>ruby extconf.rb
<P>should create a makefile, or complain.
If it complains, and you wished it would say a little more, you can edit extconf.rb
and uncomment the DEBUG-flag.
<P>make
<P>And now, as root:
<P>make install
<P>Have a nice day!

<H4>Windows</H4>

<H5>Source</H5>
Install CygWin first, then install Ruby
(<A HREF="http://www.rubycentral.com/">this version</A>)
in the same directory.
Put the RUDL source in your cygwin home directory,
and continue like in Linux.

<H5>Binary</H5>
<P>Starting with 0.5, there will be binary versions.
All that will have to be done is run a small script and it should be installed.
Offcourse, you'll need to get the following libraries:

<H4>Required libraries</H4>

<P><A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL 1.2</A> ofcourse.

<H4>Optional libraries</H4>

<P><A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/index.html">SDL_image</A>, which brings
along dependencies on <A HREF="http://www.ijg.org/">libjpeg</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html">libpng</A>, 
and <A HREF="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib">zlib</A>.
<P><A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/index.html">SDL_mixer</A>
<P><A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/index.html">SDL_ttf</A>, which depends on
libttf.
Does anybody have a precompiled libSDL_ttf for Windows?

<H3>Use RUDL</H3>

<H4>Accessing RUDL</H4>

<P>First steps: all of it is in a library called RUDL, so do a
<P>require 'RUDL'
<P>before you start using any of it.
Eveything is namespaced by using a module.
What that means is that there are two ways of accessing the things in RUDL.
First, you can refer to any object in RUDL by sticking
<P>RUDL::
<P>in front of it, like RUDL::Surface or RUDL::EventQueue.
This is visually ugly.
The next solution is conceptually ugly.
You can also include RUDL, mixing it's namespace into the current namespace.
<P>include RUDL
<P>will do that.
This might clash with other libraries who define the same names to be something else.
<P>There is also a Constant namespace inside the RUDL namespace.
It might be bearable to leave it there, refering to it as RUDL::Constant:: or
Constant:: when RUDL is included.
Constant can also be included, polluting your current namespace with around 200
constants.

<H4>Datatypes</H4>

<P>The following datatypes are commonly used by RUDL:
<P>When a coordinate, size or such is needed, RUDL works with array's of two numbers like
[10,42].
<P>When a rectangle is needed: either an array of four numbers, representing x,y from the 
top left corner, and w,h for width and height: [x,y,w,h], or a Rect object, which has x, y,
w and h members. Return values are of the array type.
<P>When a color is needed, always use an array of [r, g, b] or [r, g, b, a].
Return values are like this too, I don't know if sometimes returning three, sometimes
returning four values is wanted...?
<P>A palette is an array containing [r, g, b] arrays.
