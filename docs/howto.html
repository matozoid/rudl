<H2>Ways to do stuff</H2>

<H3>Install RUDL</H3>

<H4>Install SDL</H4>

<P>Nothing special for now.
Just install it.

<H4>Linux</H4>

<P>Like other extensions:
<P>ruby extconf.rb
<P>should create a makefile, or complain.
If it says it can't find things,
make sure you've got everything under "Required libraries" installed.
RUDL doesn't <I>need</I> everything, just SDL actually,
but it will be severely handicapped without all libraries.
If it complains, and you wished it would say a little more, you can edit extconf.rb
and uncomment the DEBUG-flag.
<P>make
<P>And now, as root:
<P>make install
<P>Have a nice day!

<H4>Windows</H4>

<P>Don't trust this chapter, this is changing rapidly.

<H5>Source</H5>
I'll write this later.

<H5>Binary</H5>
<P>Starting with 0.6, there will be binary versions.
They are compiled with Microsoft Visual C 6.
<P>Here's how to install one:

<LI>Grab <A HREF="http://froukepc.dhs.org/rudl/download/binary/ruby/mswin32-ruby1.6.6-i586.zip">compiled Ruby</A>
<LI>Grab <A HREF="http://froukepc.dhs.org/rudl/download/binary/mswin32-rudl-0.6-bin-for-ruby-1.6.6-test.zip">compiled RUDL</A>
<LI>Grab <A HREF="http://froukepc.dhs.org/rudl/download/runtime-dll-so/mswin32-rudl-0.6-test-dll.zip">compiled support libraries</A>
(see also "Required libraries")
<LI>Grab <A HREF="http://froukepc.dhs.org/rudl/download/applications/polyscope-by-martin-stannard.zip">polyscope</A>
<LI>Unzip Ruby from <B>mswin32-ruby1.6.6-i586.zip</B> to somewhere like <B>C:\RUBY</B>.
<LI>Unzip RUDL.so from <B>mswin32-rudl-0.6-bin-for-ruby-1.6.6-test.zip</B> into <B>C:\RUBY\LIB\RUBY\1.6\I586-MSWIN32</B>
<LI>Unzip the supporting dlls from <B>mswin32-rudl-0.6-test-dll.zip</B> into either <B>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM</B>,
<B>C:\WINNT\SYSTEM</B> or some other directory where they can be found.
<LI>Unzip <B>polyscope-by-martin-stannard.zip</B> anywhere.
<LI>Start polyscope.rb.
<LI>Windows should now pop up a window with a browse button.
Browse to C:\RUBY\BIN\RUBY.EXE and tell Windows to always use that program to run rb files.
If it doesn't pop up a window, your ruby files are associated with another program, 
probably another ruby somewhere on your system.
In an explorer, go to tools, folder options, where you can find the rb extension.
Delete it and repeat from the previous point.
<LI>Polyscope should run.</OL>

<P>If it doesn't run, mail me...

<H4>Required libraries</H4>

<P><A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL 1.2</A> ofcourse.

<H4>Optional libraries</H4>

<P><A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/index.html">SDL_image</A>, which brings
along dependencies on <A HREF="http://www.ijg.org/">libjpeg</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html">libpng</A>, 
and <A HREF="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib">zlib</A>.
<P><A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/index.html">SDL_mixer</A>
<P><A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/index.html">SDL_ttf</A>, which depends on
libttf.

<H3>Use RUDL</H3>

<H4>Accessing RUDL</H4>

<P>First steps: all of it is in a library called RUDL, so do a
<P>require 'RUDL'
<P>before you start using any of it.
Eveything is namespaced by using a module.
What that means is that there are two ways of accessing the things in RUDL.
First, you can refer to any object in RUDL by sticking
<P>RUDL::
<P>in front of it, like RUDL::Surface or RUDL::EventQueue.
This is visually ugly.
The next solution is conceptually ugly.
You can also include RUDL, mixing it's namespace into the current namespace.
<P>include RUDL
<P>will do that.
This might clash with other libraries who define the same names to be something else.

<H4>Datatypes</H4>

<P>The following datatypes are commonly used by RUDL:
<P>When a coordinate, size or such is needed, RUDL works with array's of two numbers like
[10, 42].
<P>When a rectangle is needed: either an array of four numbers, representing x,y from the 
top left corner, and w,h for width and height: [x, y, width, height], or a Rect object, which has x, y,
w and h members. Return values are of the array type.
<P>When a color is needed, always use an array of [red, green, blue] or [red, green, blue, alpha].
Return values are like this too, I don't know if sometimes returning three, sometimes
returning four values is wanted...?
<P>A palette is an array containing [r, g, b] arrays.
