<h1>RUDL Tutorial</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a short tutorial to RUDL, the SDL library wrapper for Ruby.
With RUDL you can create impressive games, applications, animations,
visualizations, or whatever you want. And it's quick and more importantly,
FUN to do, thanks to the ease of Ruby programming. Ruby is also fast
enough for surprisingly complex things, so prototyping your graphics-related
ideas with it is very easy.
</p>

<p>This tutorial assumes previous knowledge of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li> basics of Ruby programming </li>
    <li> basics of computer graphics: what are..
        <ul>
            <li>pixels, RGB values</li>
            <li>bitmap images (a.k.a raster images)</li>
            <li>Cartesian coordinates (x,y)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Installing RUDL is explained in <a href="howto_install.html">another document</a>.
<p>We recommend trying out all the examples in this tutorial to see what exactly
they do. After reading this tutorial, you'll be well on your way to creating the
next RUDL masterpiece!
</p>


<h2>Opening a window or screen</h2>

<p>Naturally the first thing we'll need is a window to draw on, or the whole screen.
We need to load the RUDL library and create a DisplaySurface. The following example
opens a window 300 pixels wide and 200 pixels high, waits for 3 seconds, and exits.</p>
<pre>
require "RUDL"
include RUDL
include Constant

win = DisplaySurface.new([300,200])

sleep 3
</pre>

<p>First, we load the RUDL library with <code>require "RUDL"</code> (where "RUDL" must be written in
upper case). RUDL defines its classes under the module named <code>RUDL</code>, and all constants
in module <code>RUDL::Constant</code>. We <code>include</code> those modules at the top level, so that
we won't need to type <code>RUDL::</code> in front of all RUDL class names.
</p>

<p>You'll notice that the window size, 300x200, is given as an array. All coordinates in RUDL are
expressed as [x, y] arrays, and rectangles are [x, y, width, height]. When creating surfaces
for example, the sizes are [width, height] arrays. RUDL defines some
<a href="rudl_video_rect.html">shortcut methods</a> in the Array class, most notably
<code>Array#x</code> and <code>Array#y</code>. These return the first and
second element, respectively.
</p>
<blockquote>(make this a fancy "hint box"? is this hint 100% accurate?-) You can also use floating point
values for coordinates, and they will automatically be rounded down to integers.
</blockquote>

<p><code>DisplaySurface.new</code> takes optional second and third arguments. The second
argument can contain flags, which are usually omitted, or <code>FULLSCREEN | HWSURFACE</code>
if you want to set a full screen mode with the given size as the resolution. The third argument is
the color depth (8 for paletted 256-color, 16 for hi-color, 24 or 32 for true color).
