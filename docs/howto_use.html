<H1>How to use RUDL</H1>

<H2>Accessing RUDL</H2>

<P>First steps: all of it is in a library called RUDL, so do a
<P>require 'RUDL'
<P>before you start using any of it.
Eveything is namespaced by using a module.
What that means is that there are two ways of accessing the things in RUDL.
First, you can refer to any object in RUDL by sticking
<P>RUDL::
<P>in front of it, like RUDL::Surface or RUDL::EventQueue.
This is visually ugly.
The next solution is conceptually ugly.
You can also include RUDL, mixing it's namespace into the current namespace.
<P>include RUDL
<P>will do that.
This might clash with other libraries who define the same names to be something else.

<H2>What is the idea?</H2>

<P>When you want to make a 2D program, create a DisplaySurface.
This is used for drawing on.
Load some images from disk into Surfaces with load_new.
Go into a loop, and do "game logic", "blit (paste) the surfaces to the displaysurface"
followed by "displaysurface.flip" to show them.
<P>If you feel like donating a better tutorial, go ahead :)
Use the samples!

<H2>Datatypes</H2>

<P>The following datatypes are commonly used by RUDL:
<P>When a coordinate, size or such is needed, RUDL works with array's of two numbers like
[10, 42].
<P>When a rectangle is needed one uses an array of four numbers, 
representing x,y from the top left corner of the screen, 
and w,h for width and height: [x, y, width, height].
Ruby's Array class is extended with a lot of methods to enable things like
[5,10,30,30].y (which will be 10)
<p>No checks are done on array length when a method receives a coordinate or rectangle,
this enables you to pass a rectangle to a method that wants a coordinate.
Only the first two elements will be used
(pass [3,4,6,7] and the coordinate will be [3,4])
<P>When a color is needed, always use an array of [red, green, blue],
a [red, green, blue, alpha] array or a hexadecimal 32 bit number: 0xFF8040EE.
Return values are arrays, I don't know if sometimes returning three, sometimes
returning four values is wanted...?
<P>A palette is an array containing [r, g, b] arrays.
