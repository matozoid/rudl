<H1>How to use RUDL</H1>

<H2>Accessing RUDL</H2>

<P>First steps: all of it is in a library called RUDL, so do a

<pre>require "RUDL"</pre>

<p>before you start using any of it. Also make sure to type "RUDL" in upper case,
otherwise it won't work.

<p>Eveything is namespaced by using a module.
What that means is that there are two ways of accessing the things in RUDL.
First, you can refer to any object in RUDL by sticking

<PRE>RUDL::</PRE>

<p>in front of it, like RUDL::Surface or RUDL::EventQueue.
This is visually ugly.
The next solution is conceptually ugly.
You can also include RUDL, mixing it's namespace into the current namespace.

<pre>include RUDL</pre>

<P> will do that. This might clash with other libraries who define the same
names to be something else.

<H2>What is the idea?</H2>

<P>When you want to make a 2D program, create a DisplaySurface.
This is used for drawing on.
Load some images from disk into Surfaces with load_new.
Go into a loop, and do "game logic", "blit (paste) the surfaces to the displaysurface"
followed by "displaysurface.flip" to show them.

<P>We're working on a good tutorial for RUDL, but for now,
try the samples and read their code, and browse the
<a href="RUDL/index.html">library reference</a>.

<H2>Datatypes</H2>

<P>The following datatypes are commonly used by RUDL:

<P>When a coordinate, size or such is needed, RUDL works with arrays of two numbers like [10, 42].

<P>When a rectangle is needed, use an array of four numbers,
representing x, y from the top left corner of the screen, and width and height:
[x, y, width, height].
Ruby's Array class is extended with a lot of methods to enable things like:
<pre>
rectangle = [5, 10, 30, 30]
puts rectangle.y
</pre>
<p>(which will print 10)

<p>No checks are done on array length when a method receives a coordinate or rectangle,
this enables you to pass a rectangle to a method that wants a coordinate.
Only the first two elements will be used (pass [3, 4, 6, 7] and the coordinate will be [3, 4])

<P>When a color is needed, always use an array of [red, green, blue],
a [red, green, blue, alpha] array or a hexadecimal 32 bit number: 0xFF8040EE.

<P>A palette is an array containing [r, g, b] arrays.
