@section Introduction
This is an attempt at a menu-style game interface as seen in many games today.
I have tried to keep things simple, since this was made to help people like me,
who hate to build the user interface for a game.

Improvements are very welcome, but be sure that things stay simple!

An example can be found in "gameguitest.rb"
